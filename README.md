My Favorite Dish
Pad Thai is stir-fried rice noodle dish ubiquitous with Thai cuisine in the United States, but it wasn't always popular in Thailand. With World War II nearing, the Thai government created the dish to promote a sense of national unity. “Noodle is Your Lunch” was a national campaign in which people were given free carts if they were willing to sell pad Thai and restaurants were handed recipes. Fast forward to 2002, when the government launched the (wildly successful) "Global Thai" program to promote tourism and increase popularity in Thai cuisine.
